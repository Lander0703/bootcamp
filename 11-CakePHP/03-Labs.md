## CakePHP Labs

### Lab 1 - Add Sessions

[</> code](https://github.com/stack-x/cake.example.com/commit/9d8a65128621e75f8f17c95925ad27219e5b786b) Add an instance variable to hold the session object, set this variable during initialization. The following reads as "set this instance of ```$session``` to the session object from this instance of the request object." This will provide a short hand for accessing the session data in controllers.

*src/Controller/AppController.php* add to Line 40 and line 47
```php
    //line 40
    protected $session;

    public function initialize()
    {
        ...

    //line 47
        $this->session = $this->getRequest()->getSession();
    }
```

#### Deny Access by Default
[</> code](https://github.com/stack-x/cake.example.com/commit/44f8149e1b6dda45d8ffa37f13f4b9d8852dafc3)
*src/Controller/AppController.php*
```php
public function initialize(): void
{
    parent::initialize();

    // Load the AUTH component
    $this->loadComponent('Auth');

    $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
    $this->loadComponent('Flash');
    $this->session = $this->getRequest()->getSession();

    // Deny unauthorized access by default
    $this->Auth->deny();
}
```

At this point when you try to access [http://loc.cake.example.com](http://loc.cake.example.com) the application will try to redirect you to *users/login*. This will error out due to us (a) not having a UsersController at the top level and (b) not having a route that directs us to the CakeDC plugin. We will resolve this by adding a route.

[</> code](https://github.com/stack-x/cake.example.com/commit/b32d232a8f74ff1e9512b0cb8c10e9afe332a977) Add the following at line 80 of *src/config/routes.php*

```php

Router::connect(
    '/users/login',
    [
        'plugin' => 'CakeDC/Users',
        'controller' => 'Users',
        'action' => 'login'
    ]
);

```

Now accessing [http://loc.cake.example.com](http://loc.cake.example.com) will redirect you to a login page.

### [Configuration](https://github.com/CakeDC/users/blob/master/Docs/Documentation/Configuration.md)


Navigate to [http://loc.cake.example.com/users/add](http://loc.cake.example.com/users/add) and create a user account.

### Lab 2 - Composer

Using the documentation for the users plugin, add the ability to log in using a social media platform of your choice.
> #### If you want to use social login features...

```composer require league/oauth2-facebook:@stable
composer require league/oauth2-instagram:@stable
composer require league/oauth2-google:@stable
composer require league/oauth2-linkedin:@stable
composer require league/oauth1-client:@stable
```
> NOTE: you'll need to enable social login if you want to use it, social login is disabled by default. 
```
Configure::write('Users.config', ['users']);
Configure::write('Users.Social.login', true); //to enable social login
```
> then in your config/users.php
```
return [
    'OAuth.providers.facebook.options.clientId' => 'YOUR APP ID',
    'OAuth.providers.facebook.options.clientSecret' => 'YOUR APP SECRET',
    'OAuth.providers.twitter.options.clientId' => 'YOUR APP ID',
    'OAuth.providers.twitter.options.clientSecret' => 'YOUR APP SECRET',
    //etc
];
```
> ### **IMPORTANT:** Remember you'll need to configure your social login application callback url to use the provider specific endpoint, for example:
```
Facebook App Callback URL --> http://yourdomain.com/auth/facebook
Twitter App Callback URL --> http://yourdomain.com/auth/twitter
Google App Callback URL --> http://yourdomain.com/auth/google
etc.
```
> ### *Note: Choose your most used log-in type. Using social authentication is not required.* Check the [Configuration page](https://github.com/CakeDC/users/blob/master/Docs/Documentation/Configuration.md) for more details.

### Lab 3 - Comment System

1. Create a table
  * id - the primary key of the comment system
  * post_id - the id of the article for which the comment is being made
  * first_name - the first name of the reader making a comment
  * last_name - the last name of the reader making a comment
  * email - the email of the reader making a comment
  * comment - the reader's comment
  * created - current timestamp at the time of submission
1. At the bottom of each article provide a form that will collect the above data and on submit
  * Save the data to the comments table

### Lab 4 - Contact Form

1. Create a contact form.
1. When a user submits the form, save the contents to a database.
1. When the user submits the form, use the MailGun API to send your self an email every time someone submits the contact form.

If youâ€™ve made it this far, congratulations, you now have a simple blog that:
* Allows authenticated users to create and edit articles.
* Allows unauthenticated users to view articles.
